## DriveCar
A full-stack web application developed using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript for the frontend, NodeJS and Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The site enables users to view car information, add favorite cars, explore car categories, search for specific cars, and filter by category and year. Built using the MVC architecture, the application incorporates CRUD operations with a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for document retrieval, creation, update, and deletion. The Jade language serves as the view, while NodeJS and Express function as the controller and model, respectively, handling data flow and application logic.
